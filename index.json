That\u0026rsquo;s correct, but you should be able to replicate the same procedure on other operating systems without much headaches.\nThis tutorial works on:\nWindows, Linux and MacOS, with some minor differences in file/folder picker and overall UI. VSCodium (A truly open VS Code experience, without the proprietary or AI integrations). Tip: You can click on images to zoom in and out.\nPrerequisites # Installation of VS Code. An up to date operating system. A few minutes of your spare time. :) Setup # Open VS Code and go to Extensions. Search for sftp.\nInstall SFTP extension from Natizyskunk author (actively maintained and updated).\nClick Trust Publisher \u0026amp; Install. Press Ctrl + Shift + P or click View \u0026gt; Command Palette..., and type sftp config. Click on SFTP: Config. Click on Open Folder in notification area. Create a new folder, name it however you want, make sure it\u0026rsquo;s selected and click Select Folder. Click Yes, I trust the authors (it\u0026rsquo;s your own empty folder, so it\u0026rsquo;s safe). Press Ctrl + Shift + P or click View \u0026gt; Command Palette..., and type sftp config. Click on SFTP: Config (same as step 5). A file named sftp.json will be opened. You will need to update 3 required fields in this file:\nhost -\u0026gt; files.peanuthost.net port -\u0026gt; 42069 username -\u0026gt; see steps below on how to acquire your username In order to get your username for your server (different for each server you own), you will need to follow the following steps:\nLogin on PeanutHost panel with your account. Click on your server. Click on Settings and then on SFTP Details \u0026gt; Username. The username will then get copied to the clipboard. If that\u0026rsquo;s not the case, just select + copy, like usually. Now you can update the sftp.json file in VS Code. Save the file. Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re on the SFTP module. Click on Refresh button or on My Server in order to login. Type the password of your PeanutHost panel account and press Enter. Congratsulations! You have successfully connected to your PeanutHost server files. Now you can create, modify and delete files/folders, right from your VS Code installation.
